jQuery Mobile less themes
======

Create jQuery Mobile themes using [less.js](https://github.com/cloudhead/less.js)

This repo is **inactive**, because shortly after I ported the css files the themeroller (http://jquerymobile.com/themeroller/) was released. I recommend you use this instead.


Creating a theme
==========

Fork the repo and copy the `themes/default` folder and give it the name of your theme. Now start editing `variables.less` to create your own theme. You may need to edit `theme.less` and `mixins.less` as well as create and edit images in the `images` folder, depending on how much you want to change.


Folder structure
==========

* themes
	* default (One folder for each theme)
		* images (Image files for the theme)
